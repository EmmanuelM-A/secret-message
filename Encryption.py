# Iterate through the message getting each character

# Match each character to its mapping value

# Randomly select replacement character(s)

# Take record of the character subsituted and index of the replacement to form the key: [[char, sub], [char2, sub2], [char3, sub2]]

# Once complete, combine the key elements into one string

# Shift the characters left in the string by N amount

# Append that N amount onto the end of the key string: .............N

# Print the cipher_text

# Print the key - Used to decrypt the cipher_text
